This is a project about analyzing and predicting the landing location of SpaceX Falcon 9. The project was developed through the IBM data science course, starting with web scraping and API integration to gather data from different websites to build a database. SQL was then used to extract and analyze the desired data, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize the data on a web-based interface.

The project's main objective was to identify the factors that influence the landing location of Falcon 9 rockets. The analysis focused on the impact of the rocket's trajectory, weather conditions, and other external factors that could affect its landing position. This information was then used to develop a predictive model that could forecast the landing location of future Falcon 9 launches.

Web scraping and API integration were critical components of the project. These techniques allowed the team to collect large volumes of data from multiple sources, including weather data and launch details from SpaceX's website. This information was then stored in a database, allowing the team to access it easily and manipulate it using SQL.

EDA was also an important aspect of the project. The team used visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visual representations of the data, making it easier to identify patterns and trends. These visualizations were then used to build a web-based interface that displayed the results of the analysis.

The final product was a predictive model that used machine learning techniques to forecast the landing location of future Falcon 9 launches. The model was trained using historical data, and its accuracy was tested using cross-validation techniques. The results showed that the model was able to accurately predict the landing location of Falcon 9 rockets with a high degree of accuracy.

Overall, this project demonstrated the power of data science techniques in analyzing and predicting the landing location of Falcon 9 rockets. It showed how web scraping, API integration, SQL, and EDA can be used to gather, store, and analyze large volumes of data, leading to the development of predictive models that can inform future launch decisions.
